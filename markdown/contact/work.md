I am currently not open for work at the moment because I am more focused on finishing school
and upskilling through building and maintaining projects in the open, but I am open to
receive offers, except that I may slow to reply on them. Sorry if I couldn't reply lately.

## What I am looking for?

* All-remote jobs, as much as possible.
    * If relocation to another country is needed, consider sponsor my costs for passport + visa application, flights and rent.
    * For in-office/onsite work, must be near Marilao, Bulacan.
* Fair wages and benefits adjusted to inflation (might seems to be unrealistic in PH I guess)
* Health insurance, preferably with mental health and therapy coverage.
    * either as part of benefits or as reimbursable expense

## You up?

Reach me up over [LinkedIn] or [via email][email-contact]. While I may entertain recruiters
using platforms outside of these, I only reply via email or LinkedIn.
