## ðŸ“§ Email

!!! info "Please just use one email address when sending messages privately."
    Don't send your email to multiple addresses (even as BCC or CC), it might cause duplication.

The most preferred address to use is either [:e-mail: **ajhalili2006@andreijiroh.dev**](mailto:ajhalili2006@andreijiroh.dev)
(my personal address) or [:e-mail: **ajhalili2006@crew.recaptime.dev**](mailto:ajhalili2006@crew.recaptime.dev),
(my RecapTime.dev staff address) although if Uberspace or VK WorkMail has flagged your mail as spam and you don't
want to fill up not-spam forms, [use this Tally form](https://tally.so/r/nrB4o2) as an alternative.

* **Gmail user?** You could try sending mail to [:e-mail: ajhalili2006@gmail.com](mailto:ajhalili2006@gmail.com)
(sharing docs and files over Google Drive are fun but please no spam).
* If you're using Microsoft 365 (personally), you may also try sending (or sharing OneDrive files) to [:e-mail: ajhalili2006@outlook.ph](mailto:ajhalili2006@outlook.ph).
For work-related file sharing, please use my `@crew.recaptime.dev` or `@andreijiroh.dev` email address instead.

## ðŸ’¬ Chat

### :simple-telegram: Telegram

### ðŸ¤– Discord

My Discord username (`ajhalili2006`) is pretty much the same across my socials. If we are in in any common
Discord servers, please contact me in an appropriate channel within the server. Direct messages are probably
fine too, but I rarely check them on Discord. I am often looking at these Discord servers:

* lounfe.andreijiroh.dev ([invite link](https://discord.gg/TBD))
* Gildedguy's Gilded Guild

## ðŸ‘¥ Over at socials

For the full list, see [this page](../links.md). You can obviously ping/tag me, but please be careful,
especially when replying to others' posts.

If you want to slide into DMs, only slide via my main account and not any of my alternate accounts (although
I may look into them but reply on my main). The following are my main accounts across the internet,
in order of preference:

* :openweb-icons-fediverse: [@ajhalili2006@tilde.zone](https://tilde.zone/@ajhalili2006) or [@ajhalili2006@verified.coop](https://verified.coop/@ajhalili2006)
* :simple-tumblr: [@ajhalili2006@tumblr.com](https://tumblr.com/ajhalili2006) ([askbox](https://www.tumblr.com/new/ask/ajhalili2006))
* :material-twitter: [@ajhalili2006@twitter.com](https://twitter.com/@ajhalili2006) (or `@ajhalili2006@x.com` if you're pedantic)
* :simple-linkedin: [@ajhalili2006@linkedin.com](https://linkedin.com/in/ajhalili2006)
* :simple-messenger: [@ajhalili2006](https://m.me/ajhalili2006) [^1]

## ðŸ”’ Encryption

See [this personal user manual page](../user-manual/encrypted-communications.md) for the full
details, but tl;dr:

* If you're using Signal or even E2EE Matrix, send me an encrypted/unencrypted-but-signed email
first to confirm your identity.
* Use your GPG key to encrypt your message over email. I will download them from your website or
GitHub/GitLab profile rather than relying on keyservers.
* My main GPG key is `4d5e631758cb9cc45941b1ce67bfc91b3da12be8` while my GPG key for `@crew.recaptime.dev`
address is `a715100e58cf60500ee159652f384539c700b263`.
