description: What ~ajhalili2006 been doing lately, sometimes behind the scenes.

Welcome to my [now page][nowpage-info] where I log what's been cooking behind the scenes.
([sneak to my nownownow entry](https://nownownow.com/p/Dxh0) for some tidbits) I'll try to
update this page on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on my schedule and if I have been
hit by (autistic) burnout.

## February 2025

### Listening on Loop

Here are the songs I listen on loop for the month of February 2025:

* Royal Blood - Tell Me When It's Too Late
* 

### Recap Time Squad and friends

TBD

### Hack Club

Grinded TBD hours of coding (mostly backend dev and literally writing Markdown content)
during [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com), and here's what I ordered in the
wind down periods (aka before the shop closes):

* USD 280 on Porkbun + Cloudflare HCB credits
* a lot of piles of stickers
* Raspberry Pi 5 for dedicated homelab server setup at home
* 

### School

You know it as the leader of your research team at Pratical Research 2 (PR 2) / Inquiries, Investigations,
and Immersion (3I / I.I.I) subject, you are always cooked between working on different aspects, keeping
team morale and recordkeeping for documentation and grading purposes.
