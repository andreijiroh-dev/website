## May 2025

### Listening on Loop

### PH Politics

Recently voted at the 2025 mid-terms elections for the first time after my
first elections for Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections in 2023.
Imagine you want to do a marathon of ABS-CBN News' [Halalan 2025] coverage after the election week.

### Recap Time Squad and friends

At Recap Time Squad side of the things, we moved `recaptime.dev` and other domains back to
Cloudflare Registrar (with my High Seas HCB credits) from Porkbun and used

### Hack Club

Grinded 148 hours of coding (mostly backend dev and literally writing Markdown
content) during [High Seas](https://highseas.hackclub.com), and here's what I
ordered in the wind down periods (aka before the shop closes):

* USD 280 on Porkbun + Cloudflare HCB credits
    * USD 20 for `recaptime.dev` (USD 25.78)
* a lot of piles of stickers (hopefully it does not get lost on mail)
* Raspberry Pi 5 for dedicated homelab server setup at home
* Another YubiKey 5C NFC because I lost the first one from Arcade (RIP)

### School

You know it as the leader of your research team at Pratical Research 2 (PR 2) / Inquiries, Investigations,
and Immersion (3I / I.I.I) subject, you are always cooked between working on different aspects, keeping
team morale and recordkeeping for documentation and grading purposes.
