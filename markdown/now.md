description: What ~ajhalili2006 been doing lately, sometimes behind the scenes.

Welcome to my [now page][nowpage-info] where I log what's been cooking behind the scenes.
([sneak to my nownownow entry](https://nownownow.com/p/Dxh0) for some tidbits) I'll try to
update this page on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on my schedule and if I have been
hit by (autistic) burnout.

## School and Work

Currently in senior high school right now, preparing some documentary requirements for
college applications in the coming weeks.

I am also not currently reading any LinkedIn messages from job recruiters and HR people at
the moment, so apologies if I didn't even read your message.

## Hack Club

I'm currently participating in [Hack Club High Seas] through doing updates to existing
projects as well as cooking something new. More news coming soon [in the blog], but in the
meanwhile you can sneak around [the tracking issue here] for spoilers.

Alongside participating inHigh Seas, I am also maintaining [a companion Slack bot] for the
`#hackclub-leeks` channel, monitoring the review queue for any possible unannounced stuff
being posted publicly, hence the channel name.

## RecapTime.dev

Since I am officially signed the fiscal sponsorship agreement for [HCB], I am currently
in the works to update the website for donation links as well as the mandatory fiscal
sponsorship disclosure.

In other news, I am also updating the doucmentation and other parts of the [Community Lorebooks]
website before I officially work on the onboarding process for new subdomains as well as updating
existing ones via GitHub Issues flow soon.
