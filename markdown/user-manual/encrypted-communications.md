## Key-signing ceremories / Web of Trust

If you would like to build your web of trust with me (and probably with your friends), let me know
(via [my meeting booking form](https://calendar.app.google/P8dvgAsvrtqi8mPR9) ([alternative link](https://coda.io/form/Schedule-a-meeting-with-ajhalili2006_deaLq2my-OX)),
or via regular chat venues).
Due to my current schedule as a high school student, I'm only accept asynchorous key-signing ceremories
for the moment.

For asynchorous ceremories, I recommend doing it publicly through [this repo](https://go.recaptime.eu.org/keysigning-ceremory)
and [`#keysigning-ceremories.recaptime.dev:envs.net`](https://matrix.to/#/#keysigning-ceremories.recaptime.dev:envs.net). In case
of in-person ceremories, taking a picture with yours truly (with your own list of PGP fingerprints on a piece of paper) is enough.
