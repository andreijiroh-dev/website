I am **Andrei Jiroh Halili** (he/they), an Autistic[^1] Filipino currently full-time student at day,
open-sourcerer[^4] at [Recap Time Squad] doing backend development in TypeScript across both
Node.js and Deno runtimes and being a [(SA)BDFL][sabdfl-wiki] on in most of its projects, a [Hack Clubber]
(joined on July 2024 during [Arcade][hc-arcade] and maintainer of [leeksbot] (companion Slack app for leeks channel), future
alumni 2025) and Alpine Linux packager (currently maintaining [GitHub CLI] [in the aports]) at night.

## What's cooking and quick links

!!! info "Looking for all the links"
    You do you: <https://links.andreijiroh.dev>

* :telescope: I’m currently working on different projects, most of them are hosted under
[Recap Time Squad] and some personal projects for [Hack Club Slack community].
* :seedling: I’m currently learning backend development in TypeScript at both
Node.js and Deno runtimes, using Postgres + SQLite for database persistence,
DevSecOps with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CI
* :memo: I regularly write articles on [Ghost](https://blog.andreijiroh.dev), alongside post my progress
and behind the scenes updates on [Hack Club Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/ajhalili2006)
* :mailbox: Want to contact me? [Go here for all the details.](./contact/index.md) Best way is via
[email](./contact/details.md#email), although expect a response within days or
weeks, depending on my availability and how cluttered my inbox is.

## More about myself

* Started in my TBD
* While my early autism diagnosis helped me through speech therapy, I am still
between masking/suffering in silence while being neurodivergent in real life.

## Tools I use and my setup

* **Laptop**: HP Notebook N0K71EA#A2N with 4 x Intel Core i7-5500U CPU @ 2.40GHz,
8 GB of RAM and 1TB internal HDD, currently daily-driving NixOS unstable.
* **Raspberry Pis**:
    * Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1 with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of SD card for
    Raspberry Pi OS + Debian 12 Bookworm, both received from one of Hack Club's YSWS programs.
* **Phone**: Infinix X6528B[^3] with Android 13, 8 GB of RAM, 248 GB of internal storage (256 GB total if adding
8 GB reserved as virtual RAM).
* **Programming Languages**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) + [Deno](https://deno.land), Bash
* **Editors**: mostly nano and [VS Code](https://vscode.dev) (switching between stable and Insiders), sometimes [Zed](https://zed.dev/)
* **Cloud development environments as service**: [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io)
* **Code forges**: Mainly [GitHub] and [GitLab SaaS][saas], also mirrors to
[~tulir's GitLab instance][mau.dev][^2], [sourcehut], [codeberg]
* **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and [GitLab CI]
* **Secrets management tools**: [dotenvx] for Git-based setup but encrypted, [Doppler SecretOps platform] for file-less remote configs
and [1Password] (mostly via [their open-source teams plan][op-oss-plan])
