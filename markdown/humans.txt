/* How is it deployed? */
   I use GitLab CI on https://mau.dev by ~tulir (https://mau.fi)
   and deployed on both Cloudflare Pages (production) and RTD Community
   (as backup in case things go wrong and for previewing changes).

   You can view the GitLab CI config used for deployments at
   https://mau.dev/andreijiroh-dev/website/-/blob/main/.gitlab-ci.yml,
   and the homemade scripts at https://mau.dev/andreijiroh-dev/website/-/tree/main/bin.
   Deployments on RTD Community can be tracked separately
   at https://readthedocs.org/projects/ajhalili2006/.
